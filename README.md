# eu-free-trade

Visualising free trade between EU members and overseas nations

These maps were part of [a paywalled "Presse" dossier on free trade](http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/5170217/Der-Kampf-um-den-Freihandel).

A self-hosted, open collection of all the maps can be found here:
